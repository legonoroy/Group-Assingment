<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan</h1>
<h1>FRIAS Group 5</h1>
</div>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p><span style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;background:#FAF7F2">The mission is to provide a
complete experience for todays&rsquo; kids with exciting fashion lifestyle products
and to organize fashion shows and cafe under one roof. We hope the website can attract
parents to buy at Frias </span><br><br>

</p>


<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p><span style="background:#FAF7F2">The evaluation process would include how long
users visit the website, what pages were visited in what order, how many times
a page was used from most used pages and least used pages, etc. Counters, weblogs,
and capture of demographic information with cookies provide constant
monitoring. It will also include advertising in social media such as <span
class=SpellE>facebook<span class=GramE>,twitter</span></span> and <span
class=SpellE>instagram</span> as most people use social media nowadays. Moreover,
we should also do the Search Engine Optimization to get the front page of
search engine. Search Engine Optimization is the process of maximizing the
number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears
high on the list of results returned by a search engine.</span></p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p style='background:#FAF7F2'>The target audience is kids and parents,
  especially mother so that we made the web design into as simple as we can. <br>
  <br>
  Because Frias have different type of target audience I would like to propose
  simple and minimalistic design.<br>
  <br>
  For the font choice I chose Serif type of font is more suitable for women and
  kids because it shows more elegance.</p>
<p style='background:#FAF7F2'>As the target is kids and parents, we used only few
  colors to attract the kids and their parents. </p>
<p style='background:#FAF7F2'>So, most kids and their parents can access our
  website by simply using the simple navigation bar. </p>
