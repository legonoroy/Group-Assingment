<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The mission is to provide a complete experience for todays’ kids with exciting fashion lifestyle products. We hope the website can attract parents to buy at Frias


The Website contains 5 global menu which is Collections, Cafe, Events, Purchase and Services.<br><br>

Homepage: contain menu to jump into collections page and about the company. It will make the website more user friendly and will encourage customers to shop.<br><br>

Collections: separated into Boys and Girls clothing as it is more organized to categorize based on gender rather than Beachwear and Jeans. It is also make it easier for Kids or parents to browse through<br><br>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>
The evaluation process would include how long users visit the website, what pages were visited in what order, how many times a page was used from most used pages and least used pages, etc. Counters, weblogs, and capture of demographic information with cookies provide constant monitoring.



</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience is kids and parents, especially mother<br><br>

Because Frias have different type of target audience I would like to propose simple and minimalistic design.<br> <br>

For the font choice I chose Serif type of font is more suitable for women and kids because it shows more elegance.<br><br>
